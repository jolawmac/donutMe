Often times it includes chocolate chips or a chocolate spread in the mix. It has the crubmling texture of a croissant. Another delicious pastry found in Israel is the sufganiyot.

Check out the link to Israeli pastries in the website section of this app for more info.")

One of my favorite pastries found in Costa Rica as pictured above is the filled croissant. This is a simple croissant filled with chocolate, pineapple, mango, apple, or other flavors. It is usually sprinkled with chocolate or powdered sugar on top to add more sweetness. Since most retaurants are locally owned in Costa Rica you get more of a homemade feel with pastries there. This only adds to the delicious experience of pastries in Costa Rica!")
